public cloud - ex: amazon , google or azure
private cloud : pivotal cloudfoundry 



aws is a public cloud 


when you create an aws account is its regular account 
it a comes a default vpc 


Landing zone: landng zone is an older verison of control 
    - orgnization id 
    - OU's was there
    - but there was no custimizations pipeline 
    - NO centralized aws config aggregator 
    - NO centralized cloud trail logs 
    - NO Centralized guardduty 
   - scp 
   - guardrails 
   - backup policies 
   - Tagging policies 

Brownfield is landing zone 


Greenfield is control tower

Control tower:

- orgnization id 
- OU's - each ou will have uniq id and we can name it
- there was no custimizations pipeline 
     it is used to attach guardrails, scp, rcp and tagging policies to OU's right after an aws account created
     it usess aws native tools - code commit, code build and code pipeline 
     code commit is now depricated but only availabe to old accounts which already have code commit repo's 

- Aws account factory - used create new aws accounts - account factoru will use aws service catalog to create the new aws account 
- control tower will create two aws accounts 
    - Audit 
       - centralied config aggregator - delegate account for config 
       - Centrzlied Guardduty         - - delegate account for guardduty 
       - Centralized Securityhub      - - delegate account for securityhub  
       - Centralized WAF              - delegate account for waf 
    - Log archive 
       centrzlied s3 bucket 
      - cloudtrail logs form all the memebr accounts accounts 
      - vpcflows logs from all the memebr accounts 
      - config data 
- centralized aws config aggregator 
- centralized cloud trail logs 
- Centralized guardduty 
- scp 
- guardrails - 3 types --preventive,detective, - these are nothing but aws config rules 
- rcp - resource control policies - new service introduced in 2025
- backup policies -
   - backup policies will be creatd in the parent account, attacthed them to OU's 
- Tagging policies 
   - tagging policies will be creatd in the parent account, attacthed them to OU's 



Governance items:

- Service catalog 
  - delegate account
  - portfolios 
     - networking - networking related 
     - Security   - iam role, user, policies and groups
     - reference arch - remain all aws services 
     - portfolios will be shared to all the member accounts 

Aws marketplace

   - we will add approved list of products form market place 
   - once product is purchaed and subcrbed, the license will be shared to the request account only using aws license manager(not Saas prodcuts).

Aws license manager: delegate account 
   - private marketplace and license manager will be in the same account 
   - tracks the usage subcribed products 

GAMI(glodenAMI):

to build new goldern amis:
  - Packer (hashicrop)
  - aws ec2 image builder 
   Falours:

    amazon linux2 - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    amaaonz linux3 - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    redhat         - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent  
    centos         - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    ubuntu        - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    Debian         - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    rockylinux     - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    EKS AMI        - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    ECS AMI        - security agents naming prisma defender, cloudwatch agent and monitoring agent 
    EMR 

- each of these ami's will be scanned by devsecops team using primsa 
- once the reports are clear with no bugs or issues, then we will share the ami to all the member accounts to use 
- every quarter a new version of GAMI will be released for all the linux falours, eks abd ecs
- each ami will be tagged with Version of GAMI for tracking and reporting 

    ex: 



budgets: Delegeate accounts is control tower account 
    
   each account will set with budget amount, when its used about 80 % an notificatin being to account owner, another notification once it reached to 100 %.


Cost anamoly Detection: Delegate account will be control tower account 

 cost anamoly detection uses cost explorer cur report to find the cost anamolies 


 

Config:

DNS: 
- core-dns is the deletegate account 
- resolver rules will be shared to all the member accounts using ram (resource access manager)


core Networking: core-network-services account is the delegate account

- Direct connect 
- Direct gateway
- Transit Gateway
- Transit routetables
- STNO 
- aws site-site-vpn

Guardy Duty: 

Security HUb 

WAF

Backup 

Tagging 

Compute optimizer: 
-  delegate account - core-sharedservices 

S3 lens:
- delegate account - core-sharedservices 

Patching with SSM:
- delegate account - core-sharedservices
